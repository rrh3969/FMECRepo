        <h1>Our History</h1>
        <p>A letter dated June 8, 1978 announced a meeting to be held at the Cheektowaga Training Academy for te purposes of forming a Museum for Firematic Equipment. Individuals from both the Career and Volunteer Fire Fighters attended the meeting and, led by Fred Langdon (Past Commissioner of Buffalo), held additional meetings at various locations to establish a Museum that would be open to all persons of all ages and provide a "Visual History of Firefighting".<br><br>
          The original name chosen for this organization was the "Fire Museum of Erie County". It's philosophy was to provide a facility that will be a depository for Firematic Equipment and Memorabilia, where the public can view the History of Firefighting. This facility will be used in conjunction with the Fire Training Academy and become a dispensary of Fire Prevention Materials, Fire Safety Education of Schools, Industry, and the general public.<br><br>
          Attorney Michael Fitzgerald stated that they may have legal problems with the Attorney General on the philosophy and the name, due to very specific Laws governing this type of organization.<br><br> 
          A new name was chosen "Firemen's Memorial Exhibit Center of Western New York Inc. and it's purpose stated as follows:</p>
        <div class="m-3"><q>To provide a center where that tradition of service exemplified by the 	members and equipment of the Fire Departments and Volunteer Fire 	Companies may be displayed, discussed, encouraged and otherwise 	conveyed to the public.</q></div>
        <p>In 1979 the Organization received its Corporation Papers. The first Officers were:</p>

        <p>The Center conducted a fund drive seeking financial support from individuals, Clubs, Businesses and other Organizations. Upon hearing of the plans several Fire Companies and Auxiliaries made donations and are considered Charter Members. 
<br><br>
Many of the Volunteer Fire Companies and Career Departments have equipment that cannot be displayed because of lack of space. Several individuals who have badges, helmets, buckets, pictures, and models, have promised to give or loan them to the Center. 
<br><br>
The activities of this organization diminished during 1982-1984. In 1985 new Officers were elected and meetings have been conducted monthly since that time. Several fund raising drives were conducted to raise money for a building. 
<br><br>
The goal of the Exhibit Center has been to have a building in place that will allow us to display our collection and begin our Fire Prevention Education Program. We are proud to announce that we have purchased a 6500 Sq. Ft. building at 4141 Seneca St in West Seneca, New York. Several of our members have spent many hours over the last three years bringing the building up to meet Town Building Code and making the necessary modifications to allow us to display our artifacts and conduct our programs. It began with having the leaking front flat roof repaired, then removal of the old restrooms and rebuilding two new handicap accessible restrooms. The outside block walls needed some repair, an overhead door opening and then repainted. Only the roof, the restroom plumbing, and the overhead door were done by outside contractors. The front suspended ceiling had to be removed, the ceiling insulated, and a new suspended ceiling installed. We also have fifty new light fixtures throughout the building. Most of the electric service in the building had to be rearranged. The majority of the building was filled with shelves that had to be removed. The inside wall paneling was also removed, the window openings insulated and the panels put back up. We also installed a phone system. We were able to open our doors to the public on June 18, 2005. We are still working on improving our displays. 
<br><br>
The Center collection consists of many helmets, fire extinguishers, two wheel chemical carts, fire radios, alarm boxes, alarm sending units, ticker tape unit, a dispatchers console, speaking trumpets, straight pipes, nozzles, fittings, smoke and heat detectors, ladders, pictures, plaques, patch collection, badge collections, glass and mug collection, Firematic models and toys. In addition the rolling stock includes two wheel Hose Carts from the Rough & Ready Fire Company, Williamsville; Union Fire Company, West Seneca; Woodlawn Fire Company, Hamburg: a four wheel hose cart from the East End Active Hose Company, East Aurora; a Ladder Wagon from Gowanda Fire Company, and another from an unknown source. Our motorized collection includes a 1932 Buffalo Appliance Engine from East Aurora Fire Department, a 1936 Chevrolet Engine from the Patchin Fire Company, a 1947 Buffalo Appliance Engine from the Kenilworth Fire Company, a 1954 Ward LaFrance "Fireball" Engine from the East Amherst Fire Company and a 1968 Int'l Chassis with a Darley Body from a private owner. These items and more are on display at our building. </p>
